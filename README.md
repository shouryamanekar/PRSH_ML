## Research Project: Investigating Risk Factors Associated with Self-Harm and Harm to Others using Machine Learning

This GitHub repository contains the research project that aims to investigate the risk factors associated with self-harm and harm to others using various machine learning algorithms. The study utilizes Multilayer Perceptron Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression algorithms to predict self-harm and harm to others based on data collected through a survey conducted on Google Forms.

### Objective
The main objective of this research project is to gain insights into the predictive performance of different machine learning algorithms, interpret the models' results, and establish statistical associations between risk factors and self-harm/harm to others.

### Key Findings
The results of this study suggest that machine learning algorithms can effectively predict self-harm and harm to others based on the collected data. The best-performing algorithms have been identified, and their strengths and limitations in predicting self-harm and harm to others have been discussed. The interpretability techniques used in the study, such as feature importance rankings, partial dependence plots, and LIME, have provided valuable insights into the key features associated with self-harm and harm to others, shedding light on potential risk factors.

Moreover, the statistical analysis results reveal significant associations between risk factors and self-harm/harm to others, providing evidence of the relationship between various variables and these outcomes.

### Limitations
It's important to consider the study's limitations when interpreting the findings and implications. These limitations include potential biases in the data, sample size limitations, and generalizability concerns.

### Impact and Implications
The research findings significantly affect mental health professionals, policymakers, and other stakeholders. The insights gained can inform the development of interventions, policies, and practices related to self-harm and harm to others, potentially contributing to the field of mental health research. Practical recommendations based on the research findings can be made to address these critical issues effectively.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, this research project, utilizing machine learning techniques, contributes to our understanding of the risk factors associated with self-harm and harm to others. The findings can be used to inform mental health research and clinical care, leading to improved interventions and prevention efforts. Further research can build upon these findings to better understand and prevent self-harm and harm to others, ultimately contributing to the field of mental health research.
